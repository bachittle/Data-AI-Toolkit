# AI-Assisted Development Workflows

This guide covers proven workflows and best practices for using Data AI Toolkit with AI assistants like Claude.

## Pull Request-Style Development

One of the most effective ways to work with AI assistants is to structure your requests like pull requests:

1. **Request Format**
   - Ask the AI to create a PR document first
   - Have it outline all planned changes before making them
   - Use this documentation for both review and actual GitHub PRs later

2. **Benefits**
   - AI assistants are well-trained on PR formats
   - Helps catch potential issues before code changes
   - Creates documentation you can reuse
   - Provides clear reasoning for changes

## Voice Input Workflow

Data AI Toolkit supports both keyboard and voice input workflows, each with unique advantages:

### Voice Input Advantages
- Natural, unfiltered brainstorming
- Can provide richer context through conversation
- Useful when away from keyboard
- Great for continuous knowledge sharing
- Might surface details you'd miss when typing
- Claude effectively extracts key information despite filler words
- Perfect for initial project discussions and planning
- Good for capturing stream-of-consciousness ideas
- Can maintain conversational flow while problem-solving

### Voice Input Considerations
- May include filler words ("like", etc.)
- Might occasionally miss key technical details
- Less precise for technical specifications
- Claude still understands context well despite conversational style
- Best for high-level discussions rather than exact code

### Keyboard Input Advantages
- More precise and structured input
- Better for exact technical requirements
- Easier to review before sending
- Great for code snippets and examples
- Allows for easy copy/paste of context from other sources
- Better for specific file edits and code review
- Helps filter out unnecessary information
- Essential for sharing external references or documentation

### Choosing Your Input Method
- Use voice for:
  - Initial brainstorming
  - High-level planning
  - When you want to capture many ideas quickly
  - When away from keyboard
  - Natural problem-solving discussions
- Use keyboard for:
  - Code reviews
  - Technical specifications
  - Precise requirements
  - Sharing code snippets
  - Adding external context
  - File editing tasks

## Development Loop

The toolkit enables a smooth development cycle:

1. **Edit Phase**
   - Share project context using Data AI Toolkit
   - Discuss changes using PR-style format
   - Let AI reason through changes
   - Review and approve the plan

2. **Commit Phase**
   - Implement approved changes
   - Use AI-generated PR documentation
   - Commit changes to GitHub

3. **Update Phase**
   - Use Data AI Toolkit to update Claude project
   - Keep AI context in sync with repository
   - Ready for next iteration

## Best Practices for AI Interaction

1. **Let AI Reason First**
   - Have AI think through problems before making changes
   - Review reasoning before approving changes
   - Catch potential issues early

2. **Be Specific**
   - Provide clear requirements
   - Break down complex tasks
   - Use examples when possible

3. **Iterative Development**
   - Start with small changes
   - Review and test frequently
   - Build up to larger features

4. **Context Management**
   - Keep AI's context up-to-date
   - Use ignore patterns effectively
   - Monitor token usage

## GitHub Integration

Data AI Toolkit works seamlessly with GitHub workflows:

1. **Documentation**
   - Use AI-generated PR documents
   - Maintain clear change history
   - Document decisions and reasoning

2. **Code Review**
   - Share review context with AI
   - Get detailed feedback
   - Address issues iteratively

3. **Version Control**
   - Keep AI context in sync with repository
   - Track changes effectively
   - Maintain project history
